          Not only does India sit at the bottom of the chart on healthcare spending among top 10 major economies covered in the analysis, it also has the lowest number of beds available at its public hospitals--- when it comes
           to public healthcare, there is only half a bed available per 1,000 people in India.
          Pune is the most equipped city in India in terms of health infrastructure offering 3.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people, according to a
           recent report by online real estate portal Housing.com.
This is much higher when compared to Indiaâ€™s national average --- in the public healthcare system, there is only half a bed and 1.4 beds 
available, if we count public plus private hospital beds available per 1,000 people in India, shows a report by the Elara Technologies-owned online realty firm.
